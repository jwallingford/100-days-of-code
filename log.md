# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've committed to 100-days-of-code, joined github, joined slack, and downloaded python 3.7.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling accomplished and optimistic that I will finally learn to code.  Thanks to kallaway & Mike Whitney for introducing me to this challenge!

### Day 1: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working through some of the basics of getting my system ready for python coding.

**Thoughts:** I went ahead and bought a Udemy course on beginning Python, so the commitment is real now.  I went through a couple of getting started videos so I'm still not working in Python yet and that's a little disappointing but I have to move on to other things.
