# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I've committed to 100-days-of-code, joined github, joined slack, and downloaded python 3.7.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling accomplished and optimistic that I will finally learn to code.  Thanks to kallaway & Mike Whitney for introducing me to this challenge!
